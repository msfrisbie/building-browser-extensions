      <br />

      5. HOW DO WE HANDLE YOUR SOCIAL LOGINS?
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      In Short: If you choose to register or log in to our services using a
      social media account, we may have access to certain information about you.
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Our Services offer you the ability to register and log in using your
      third-party social media account details (like your Facebook or Twitter
      logins). Where you choose to do this, we will receive certain profile
      information about you from your social media provider. The profile
      information we receive may vary depending on the social media provider
      concerned, but will often include your name, email address, friends list,
      and profile picture, as well as other information you choose to make
      public on such a social media platform.
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are
      described in this privacy notice or that are otherwise made clear to you
      on the relevant Services. Please note that we do not control, and are not
      responsible for, other uses of your personal information by your
      third-party social media provider. We recommend that you review their
      privacy notice to understand how they collect, use, and share your
      personal information, and how you can set your privacy preferences on
      their sites and apps.
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      6. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      In Short: We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the
      purposes outlined in this privacy notice unless otherwise required by law.
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary
      for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention
      period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other
      legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping
      your personal information for longer than 90 days.
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal
      information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if
      this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has
      been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal
      information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is
      possible.
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      7. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      In Short:  You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time.
      <br /> <br />
      If you are located in the EEA or UK and you believe we are unlawfully
      processing your personal information, you also have the right to complain
      to your local data protection supervisory authority. You can find their
      contact details here:
      https://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm.
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      If you are located in Switzerland, the contact details for the data
      protection authorities are available here:
      https://www.edoeb.admin.ch/edoeb/en/home.html.
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Withdrawing your consent: If we are relying on your consent to process
      your personal information, which may be express and/or implied consent
      depending on the applicable law, you have the right to withdraw your
      consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent at any time by
      contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section "HOW
      CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?" below.
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the
      processing before its withdrawal nor, when applicable law allows, will it
      affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance
      on lawful processing grounds other than consent.
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />

      8. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile
      applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can
      activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your
      online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no
      uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals
      has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser
      signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice
      not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted
      that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice
      in a revised version of this privacy notice.
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />

      In Short: Yes, if you are a resident of California, you are granted
      specific rights regarding access to your personal information.

      <br />
      California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the "Shine The Light"

      from us, once a year and free of charge, information about categories of
      personal information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct
      marketing purposes and the names and addresses of all third parties with
      which we shared personal information in the immediately preceding calendar
      year. If you are a California resident and would like to make such a
      request, please submit your request in writing to us using the contact
      information provided below.
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      If you are under 18 years of age, reside in California, and have a
      registered account with Services, you have the right to request removal of
      unwanted data that you publicly post on the Services. To request removal
      of such data, please contact us using the contact information provided
      below and include the email address associated with your account and a
      statement that you reside in California. We will make sure the data is not
      publicly displayed on the Services, but please be aware that the data may
      not be completely or comprehensively removed from all our systems (e.g.,
      backups, etc.).
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />

      will be indicated by an updated "Revised" date and the updated version
      will be effective as soon as it is accessible. If we make material changes
      to this privacy notice, we may notify you either by prominently posting a
      notice of such changes or by directly sending you a notification. We
      encourage you to review this privacy notice frequently to be informed of
