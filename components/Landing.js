              covers all the knowledge you will need to write cross-browser
              extensions with modern tools. Browser extensions are given access
              to extremely powerful APIs. I believe most developers are blind to
              that power and are unaware of just how much it is within their
              reach. This book is designed to enlighten web developers and
              illuminate the true potential of the browser extension software
              platform.

              The transition to manifest v3 is upon us, and already it is
              causing problems. If you are confused about what manifest v3 is,
              what are its implications, and how best to navigate the ongoing
              transition, this book is for you. I dedicated an entire chapter to
              the manifest v2/v3 transition.

              The lingua franca of web development is React, and this book gives
              special attention to the best ways in which you can write a
              browser extension in React. It also covers all the supplemental
              tools youâ€™ll need along the way, such as Webpack, Parcel, and
              Plasmo.
